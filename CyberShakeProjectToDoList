CyberShake Project Summary
Purpose: Archive the CyberShake Results via ABF analysis besides of hazard curve 

ABF can show the CyberShake results in a way that decompose different model components and give a different veiw of CyberShake models. 


Metting at 09/27/2016: 
For CyberShake 14.2 study, produce the ABF maps and variance numbers/maps and show the basin and directivity effect, turn off basin/site effect in the reference model to make it basin effect, and other full, then choose to compare models. 
Setup meeting with Tom and Scott for posting models once you have the results. (do it to make yourself valuable).
