CyberShake Project Summary
Purpose: Archive the CyberShake Results via ABF analysis besides of hazard curve 

ABF can show the CyberShake results in a way that decompose different model components and give a different veiw of CyberShake models. 

Metting at 09/27/2016: 
For CyberShake 14.2 study, produce the ABF maps and variance numbers/maps and show the basin and directivity effect, turn off basin/site effect in the reference model to make it basin effect, and other full, then choose to compare models. 
Setup meeting with Tom and Scott for posting models once you have the results. (do it to make yourself valuable). 

Meeting at 10/21/2016: 
- A factor 
  Used to test the mag-area scaling 
  
  1. CS1.0  (GP07, CVMS4)
  2. CS13.4a (GP10, CVMS4)
  3. CS13.4b (GP10, CVMH with GTL) 
  4. CS14.2S4.26  (GP10, CVM-S4.26)
  5. CS14.2H   (GP10, CVM-H without GTL) 
  
  Plot a values at variaous periods for different CyberShake model to see the changes in a value along time 
  2-1 to see the impact of rupture generator changes
  3-2 to see the impact of velocity differences 
  4-2 to see the impact of velocity model updates (CVMs) 
  5-3 to see the impact of velocity model updates (CVMH)
  
- Solve the issue for CS15.4
  6. CS15.4 (higher frequency, new rupture generator GP2014, CVM-S4.26) 
  Debug the rupture 271 (solved)
  
  Program running (almost finished)
  This can be used to see the impact of high frequency (a value at shorter periods should be brought up) 
  and the impact of new rupture generator (hypocenter distribution), impacts on directivity (should be reduced)
   
  It seems the calculation of NGA2 takes the most of time (find the reason), new modules, directivity is ok it seems!

- Compare NGA models with sigma and b-map 
  With the same velocity model, old run with NGA1 and new run with NGA2 to compare their b-map and variance
  in the ABF framework, to compare the NGA2 and NGA1 
  
- Keep in mind whether the rupture set determined from disaggragation of the old runs still applies to the new runs
  convergence behavior 
  (takes time)
  
- write a report to summarize result and put your comments to illustrate the figures. 

  
Meeting at 2/15/2017 
Preparation: 
1. CS15.4 is running almost finished, and NGA2 calculation takes long time, I am going to check if using NGA1 might fast things up, 
   remember distinguish model IDs (by including the NGA model index 1 or 2, e.g. 541 or 542). I remember using NGA1 does take less time.
2. Setup the workflow on geo system (with Java, matlab, python, and necessary packages), since the personal computer takes a lot of memory 
3. Other needs for writing the paper.

Action items: 
1. Check other CS model with NGA2 (which is faster)
2. make the program work better 

Get all B-maps and pass them to Scott for posting and discussion.

In order to run ERF36 at 1.0s, we need directivity at 1.0s for all models (but why only ASK has problem?)


meeting at 3/8/2017 
0. get all CS models Bmap, A value, variance
1. Check the download process of 36 8 6 5 by using 10 and plot rupture 0 to see the ground motion as function of hypocenter index (should be the same as Scott)
2. do the ABF for CS15.4 (above downloads)
3. get the B-map and Avalue, and variance plots for Tom 


meeting at 3/14/2017 
0. redo the plots for A, B-map, and Variance (after run CS15.4 with NGA08)  
   done
1. use BA08 base as the reference model and get the residual b-map for all CyberShake models and NGA models 
   Proposed procedure: Save the BA08base at 5 periods to a file and used by all other NGA models and CyberSahke models 

2. check the way of calculation for sigma_M, especially for CS15.4 and CS-LA14.2c (bbp1D)

3. check the CS15.4 sigma M and sigma D (both variance and variance maps) [why bbp1D sigma M increases at T=10.0s]

4. interpolate some of those results and understand the meaning 

5. check the way that sigma M is calculated, for CS15.4

before next meeting, prepare those maps
