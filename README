#=========================================
ABF analysis application 
(use of pyABF for specific problems) 
#=========================================

Usage:
    Put this in your working path (different from pyABF), while pyABF should be added to your python path (see pyABF README)

Purpose:
    Doing analysis and use those gmt scripts to generate figures of each factors
    Doing comparisons between CyberShake models and NGA models 

Content:
./data is prepared before running anything (you need to get them)
./metadata is intermediate data path to save files generated on the fly.
     * Disaggregation have the ERF35 disaggregation results used for source set selection (computed from OpenSHA)
           In pyABF, Disaggregation.py will use OpenSHA application (DisaggregationPlotter) ask Kevin for details 
     * Later, OpenSHA will compute the NGA08 related flat info (distance, site condition etc.) ask Kevin for details
       (change ./bin/nga_comparison_calc accordingly to the classpath!)

./scripts have python and GMT scripts for analysis and gmt plots
./utils have the software to compute directivity effect based on Spudish and Chiou 2008 model (matlab required)
./bin has the shell scripts that run the Java application to compute NGA flat information
     * You need to add this bin path to your system $PATH in order to use it! 

Requirements: 
    Python 2.7, 
    Java (latest) 
    GMT and Netcdf verions: 
	GMT4.5.8/
	netcdf-3.6.3/ 
    
    optional (no need to if you copy all the metadata, but if use different ERF ID, you might need to rebuild the following) 
	OpenSHA  (after svn the latest version, build them following the steps; ./data/OpenSHA/OpenSHA_Note, no need to use eclipse)
	Matlab 
    These two are required if you generate your own metadata for disaggregation and NGA, directivity outputs (add matlab in your $PATH)

Note: 
For creating OpenSHA NGA flatfiles, use ERF_ID = 35, test 36
