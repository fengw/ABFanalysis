#=========================================
ABF analysis application 
(use of pyABF for specific problems) 
#=========================================

Usage:
    Put this in your working path (different from pyABF), while pyABF should be added to your python path (see pyABF README)

Purpose:
    doing analysis and use those gmt scripts to generate figures of each factors
    doing comparisons between CyberShake models and NGA models 

Content:
./data is prepared before running anything (you need to get them)
./metadata is intermediate data path to save files generated on the fly. 
./scripts have python and GMT scripts for analysis and gmt plots
./bin has the shell scripts that run the Java application to compute NGA flat information

Requirements: 
    Python 2.7, 
    Java (latest) 
    GMT and Netcdf verions: 
	GMT4.5.8/
	netcdf-3.6.3/ 
    
    optional (if you copy all the metadata) 
	OpenSHA
	Matlab 
    These two are required if you generate your own metadata for disaggregation and NGA, directivity outputs
