Site-based data extraction workflow

0. find the site id of interest based on site name
select * from CyberShake_Sites where CS_Site_Name='s351'  (e.g.)

1. find the correct run_id for site, model, rupture model generation
select * from CyberShake_Runs where Site_ID = 282 and ERF_ID= 35 and Rup_Var_Scenario_ID=3 and Velocity_Model_ID =1
return the run_id for further usage (IM extraction)

2. get all source id, rupture id, rup_var_id available for the site of the specific run_id
select * from CyberShake_Site_Ruptures where CS_Site_ID = 282 and ERF_ID= 35 

3. select source id for specified source name (e.g., Southern San Andreas Fault)
select * from Ruptures where ERF_ID = 35 and Source_Name='S. San Andreas' 

4. check rupture variations using source_id obtained from 3
select * from Rupture_Variations where ERF_ID= 35 and Source_ID=128 and Rup_Var_Scenario_ID=3

Note: here how to find correct rupture for one source to plot the red-dot plot?
      each source and rupture, there are four rupture variations (two hypocenter and two slip distribution for each hypo)
      ??? where do the 38 rupture variations for each epicenter come from? Ask Scott and Kevin

5. check site-ruptures
select * from CyberShake_Site_Ruptures where CS_Site_ID=282 and ERF_ID= 35 and Source_ID=128 

6. visualize rupture variation (find Rup_Var_LFN and download it from disk)
select * from Rupture_Variations where ERF_ID = 35 and Source_ID=128 and Rupture_ID=0 and Rup_Var_Scenario_ID=3
From column Rup_Var_LFN get the file name

7. look the SA measurements for station based on run_id, source id and rupture id
select * from IM_types (to check Sa types, i.e., periods, and unit of Sa, components)
select * from PeakAmplitudes where Run_ID= 501 and Source_ID = 128 

8. post-processing
   get all im for various rutpure variation along one source and various hypocenter and slip distribution
   to quantitatively measure the directivity-basin coupling

   More model and rupture model sensitivity investigation follow this general procedure.
