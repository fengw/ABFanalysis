# OpenSHA usage
1. use it on shock.usc.edu (remotely)

  login:  ssh fengw@shock.usc.edu

    the Shell command line tool is in:
    /home/scec-00/cybershk/opensha/nga_comparison_calc.sh
    (Link this to your work directory as nga_comparison_calc)

    The source file for NGA calculation is in:
    /home/scec-00/cybershk/opensha/OpenSHA/src/org/opensha/sha/cybershake/calc/NGAComparisonCalc.java


2. Use it on the local machine (prefer this way)
Attention to the Java Version (Java SE 6 or Java 1.6.0) Library etc. (for the corresponding Macbook OS version)

First, check out OpenSHA as follows:

     svn co https://source.usc.edu/svn/opensha/trunk

then cd into the "ant" subdirectory (make sure you have apache ant installed) and issue these commands to build:

    ./runAnt.sh build.xml
    ./runAnt.sh build.xml resource.all
    ./runAnt.sh build.xml unjar.libs.common

?????
Every time when you add new modules in to it, you need to rebuild it? before you do this, ask Kevin
or just compile the added modules (generate *.jar in the classpth) ???
?????

Answer: you need to svn the updated version of the code and rebuild it. follow the two step
You can then copy over the "nga_comparison_calc" script, updating the "dir=..." line to point to the correct directory.


3. Use it throught eclipse
Or, you can use eclipse for a graphical environment:
https://opensha.usc.edu/trac/wiki/SettingUpEclipse#ObtainingSourceCodeviaEclipse

    Download eclipse
    http://www.open.collab.net/
    windjava
    gogofeng

4. Run programs:
    I put the nga_comparison_calc.sh as nga_comparison_calc in the $HOME/local/bin and add to path
    Then I could use nga_comparison_calc everywhere (typically, in the directory where you want to 
    save the output files)

    go to the work directory ./nga_comparison_calc <input_file>
    the input file should have format like this:
    SourceID, RuptureID, Period
   
    run it in eclipse 
    if you need put input parameters, use run configuration (very easy)
5. Outputs
    # the output (SA for four NGA models) Y1 (g)
    then Y = exp( Y1 )*9.8*100    in cm/s^2
    The output file is in csv format, you can manipulate it in python using readlines()
    or use import csv to manipulate it.
